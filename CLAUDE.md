## Project Overview

`roc-job-radar` is a personal job aggregator that scrapes Rochester, NY employer career sites and surfaces new tech roles via a web dashboard. See `SPEC.md` for the full specification.

**Current phase:** Backend active development. Frontend implemented and tested.

---

## Architecture

### Repository Layout (npm workspaces monorepo)
```
packages/backend/   Node.js + Express + TypeScript backend (active development)
packages/frontend/  React + Vite frontend (implemented)
docker-compose.yml  Base Docker config (postgres + backend)
docker-compose.override.yml  Dev overrides (hot reload, host port exposure)
```

### Key Backend Abstractions

**Scraper adapter pattern** (`packages/backend/src/scrapers/`)
- `base.ts` — `BaseScraper` abstract class. Each employer is a subclass.
- `adapters/` — One file per employer (`paychex.ts`, `wegmans.ts`, etc.)
- `pipeline.ts` — Orchestrates all adapters: fetch → filter → persist
- `filters.ts` — Keyword allowlist + department category filter
- `robots.ts` — robots.txt fetching, parsing, and 24h in-memory caching

**Database** (`packages/backend/src/db/`)
- `schema.ts` — Drizzle ORM table definitions (source of truth for DB structure)
- `client.ts` — postgres.js connection + Drizzle instance
- `migrations/` — drizzle-kit generated SQL (committed to repo)

**API** (`packages/backend/src/api/routes/`)
- `jobs.ts` — `GET /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/:id`
- `employers.ts` — `GET /api/employers`
- `scrape.ts` — `POST /api/scrape` (manual trigger), `GET /api/scrape/status`

**Scheduler** (`packages/backend/src/scheduler.ts`)
  - node-cron, schedule configurable via `SCRAPE_CRON`.
  - schedule runs once daily; required default is set in `.env` as `0 8 * * *`.
  - scheduled scraping starts disabled on every backend boot and must be enabled explicitly from the admin page.
- Only one scrape run at a time (idempotent)

### Frontend (`packages/frontend/src/`)

**3-page React app with React Router v6 + Tailwind CSS + Recharts.**

Pages:
- `/` — Home: full-width search bar, employer/status filters, card/list toggle, paginated job grid (12/page card, 20/page list), job detail modal
- `/admin` — Admin: scrape control + run now button, recent runs table, per-employer breakdown, employers table, job stats
- `/analytics` — Analytics: bar + line charts for jobs by category and by company over time

Key files:
- `pages/` — `HomePage.tsx`, `AdminPage.tsx`, `AnalyticsPage.tsx`
- `components/` — `Header.tsx`, `SearchBar.tsx`, `ViewToggle.tsx`, `Pagination.tsx`, `JobCardLarge.tsx`, `JobListRow.tsx`, `JobModal.tsx`
- `api/client.ts` — typed fetch wrappers for all backend endpoints
- `utils/analytics.ts` — pure functions `buildCurrentCounts` and `buildMonthlyTrend` (used by Analytics page and tested independently)
- `types/index.ts` — shared TypeScript interfaces

Frontend runs on port 5173 (dev) with Vite proxy to backend at port 3000.

### Data Flow
```
cron / POST /api/scrape
  → pipeline.ts: for each active employer
      → check robots.txt
      → adapter.scrape() → ScrapedJob[]
      → filters.ts: keyword + category filter
      → persist: INSERT new jobs, UPDATE last_seen_at, soft-delete removed jobs
      → log errors to scrape_errors table
```

## Dev Commands

> All commands assume Docker is running. Run from repo root unless noted.

### Start development environment
```bash
docker compose up          # starts postgres, backend, and frontend
```

- Backend hot reload runs in Docker on port `3000`.
- Frontend runs as a Dockerized Vite dev server with hot reload on port `3001`.
- Docker startup auto-runs backend migrations before the API process starts.
- After changing frontend Docker config, rebuild that service with `docker compose up -d --build frontend`.
- When `AI_ENABLED=true`, backend startup stays non-blocking. The server starts immediately, then checks or pulls `OLLAMA_MODEL` in the background.

### Start frontend dev server without Docker (optional)
```bash
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev                # Vite on port 5173, proxies /api → localhost:3000
```

### Backend only (without Docker, for rapid iteration)
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run dev                # tsx watch src/index.ts
```

### Database migrations
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run db:generate        # generate migration from schema changes (drizzle-kit)
npm run db:migrate         # apply pending migrations
```

### Migration verification (no shortcuts)

Treat the migration ledger as authoritative: do not rely on file presence alone; confirm `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` reflects applied migrations and the actual schema matches.

Use this sequence when confirming latest migrations:

```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run db:generate        # should report no unexpected pending changes
npm run db:migrate         # must be the only way schema changes are applied
npm run db:verify-journal  # verify migration SQL, journal, and ledger consistency
psql postgresql://rjr:changeme@localhost:5432/roc_job_radar -c "SELECT id, to_timestamp(created_at/1000) AS applied_at FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY id DESC;"
psql postgresql://rjr:changeme@localhost:5432/roc_job_radar -c "\\d public.scrape_run_employers"
```

CI also runs `npm --workspace @roc-job-radar/backend run db:verify-journal` on each push/PR in `.github/workflows/db-migration-ledger-check.yml`.

- If a migration SQL file exists but wasn’t applied, verify Drizzle timestamp ordering: migrations are executed only when `created_at` in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` is older than the migration’s `when` value in `src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json`.
- `npm run db:verify-journal` also validates `_journal.json` entry ordering (`when` values must be strictly increasing in `entries` order) before optional ledger checks.
- Never hand-edit tables or `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` to force schema alignment.
- Never manually alter `_journal.json`.
- Never manually alter migration metadata to force schema alignment; use `npm run db:generate` + `npm run db:migrate` and re-check with SQL.

#### Migration troubleshooting checklist

1. Confirm `.env.development` points at the intended database.
2. Run `npm run db:generate`; if it creates a change unexpectedly, regenerate migrations before continuing.
3. Run `npm run db:migrate`.
4. Run `npm run db:verify-journal` to confirm file/journal/ledger alignment.
5. Verify latest ledger rows:
   - `psql postgresql://rjr:changeme@localhost:5432/roc_job_radar -c "SELECT id, to_timestamp(created_at/1000) AS applied_at FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY id DESC;"`
6. Verify expected schema objects:
   - `psql postgresql://rjr:changeme@localhost:5432/roc_job_radar -c "\\d public.scrape_run_employers"`
7. If a known migration file still seems unapplied, compare:
   - `journal.entries[].when` in `src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json`
   - current `created_at` ledger order in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`
   - then add a new ordered migration to apply the missing DDL instead of editing history.
8. If the sequence is irreparably broken, prefer:
   - spin up a fresh DB and re-run `db:migrate`, or
   - in a disposable local DB only, align `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` with source history.

Never hand-delete or hand-edit migration metadata on shared/production databases.

### Trigger a scrape manually
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape
```

Agent policy:
- Agents must never trigger `POST /api/scrape`, run scrape seed/backfill scripts, or start employer scrapes in dev/prod unless the user explicitly asks for that action in the current turn.
- Scrape status may be inspected when needed, but write actions that start a scrape always require explicit user instruction.

### Run tests
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm test                   # vitest
npm run test:watch         # vitest --watch

cd packages/frontend
npm test                   # vitest run
npm run test:watch         # vitest
```

### Access Postgres directly (dev only — port exposed to host)
```bash
psql postgresql://rjr:changeme@localhost:5432/roc_job_radar
```

## Commit Workflow

Before creating a commit:

1. Run `git status`
2. Run `git diff`
3. Summarize the change in ONE sentence internally
4. Generate a single Conventional Commit message
5. Create the commit

### Commit Message Format

Use Conventional Commits.

Allowed types:
- feat
- fix
- docs
- refactor
- test
- chore
- ci
- build

Format:

<type>(optional-scope): <short summary>

Examples:

feat(db): add companies table
fix(scraper): handle missing job description
docs(readme): add setup instructions
chore(repo): initialize project structure

### Rules

- Commit messages must be **one line**
- Maximum **72 characters**
- Prefer the **shortest accurate message**
- Use lowercase commit types

### Do Not

- write long explanations
- include a commit body unless explicitly asked
- include multiple paragraphs
- include "This commit..." phrasing
- include "Co-authored-by: Claude" or any Claude attribution
- include "Generated by Claude", "AI assisted", or similar trailers

Claude should **never add its name or attribution** to commits.
Authorship should remain the git user configured in the repository.

---

## Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript `strict: true`** everywhere. No `any` without a comment explaining why.
- **Drizzle schema is the single source of truth** for DB structure. Never hand-edit migration SQL.
- **Migration ledger is authoritative**; treat `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` as the canonical applied-migration record.
- **Never hand-edit tables or `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`.** Reconciliation must go through migrations.
- **Never hand-edit `_journal.json`.** The `when` timestamps in `packages/backend/src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` are set by `drizzle-kit generate` and must not be modified manually. Drizzle's migrator uses these timestamps as a watermark — editing them can silently cause migrations to be skipped. All schema changes must go through `npm run db:generate` (from `packages/backend`).
- **Each employer adapter is self-contained.** All knowledge about a specific employer's site lives in its adapter file. Include a header comment documenting the ATS type, career URL, and `externalId` strategy used.
- **Errors in scrapers are caught and logged, never thrown up to the pipeline.** The pipeline continues on per-employer failure.
- **robots.txt must be checked before every adapter run.** Never bypass this.
- **Agents must not trigger scrapes unless explicitly asked.** Do not call `POST /api/scrape`, run scrape backfills, or otherwise start scraper execution just to validate code changes.
- **No auth on the API.** The server binds to localhost. Do not add public-facing auth complexity.
- **Frontend uses no component library.** Pure Tailwind utility classes only — no Shadcn, MUI, etc.
- **Frontend analytics utils are pure functions.** Keep `buildCurrentCounts` and `buildMonthlyTrend` in `utils/analytics.ts` and test them separately from the React component.

## Key Decisions (Why We Made Them)

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Drizzle over Prisma | Lighter weight, better TypeScript ergonomics, closer to SQL |
| Docker-only runtime | Targets both Mac (dev) and Windows (prod) consistently |
| In-process node-cron scheduler | Works inside Docker, consistent across platforms, no OS-level config |
| Adapter-per-employer (code, not config) | Career sites are too varied for CSS-selector configs; code adapters handle any quirk |
| Full job history in DB | Enables analytics (how long postings last, rate of new postings) |
| Soft delete for removed jobs | Preserves history; `removed_at` timestamp tells you when a job was filled/pulled |
| Keyword + category filter (both) | Category filter is precise when available; keyword filter is the fallback |
| Notifications out of scope | Personal tool — dashboard review is sufficient for MVP |
| npm over pnpm/bun | Familiarity, no compatibility edge cases |

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development` and fill in values before running.

Key env vars:
- `POSTGRES_*` — DB connection
- `SCRAPE_CRON` — cron expression for scheduler
  - required at startup (`config.ts` reads this as required)
  - default in `.env.example` is `0 8 * * *` (once daily)
  - cron is configured at startup, but scheduled scraping remains disabled until explicitly enabled from admin
- `SCRAPE_DETAIL_INTERVAL_MS` — delay between Workday detail fetches for enrichment (default: 3000ms)
- `USER_AGENT` — sent with all HTTP requests to employer sites
- `SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_MS` — per-request timeout
- `AI_ENABLED`, `AI_MAX_PARALLELISM`, and related AI settings are local `.env.development` values and are not committed repo defaults
- `OLLAMA_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` — startup wait budget for Ollama API readiness (default: 60000ms)
- `OLLAMA_PULL_TIMEOUT_MS` — startup wait budget for model discovery/pull verification (default: 600000ms)
- `.env.production.example` is the tracked production template; production startup no longer blocks on model readiness when `AI_ENABLED=true`

---

## Adding a New Employer

1. Add a row to the `employers` table (via migration or seed script).
2. Create `packages/backend/src/scrapers/adapters/<employer-key>.ts`.
3. Extend `BaseScraper`, implement `scrape()`.
4. Document in the adapter's header comment: ATS type, career URL, `externalId` strategy, scraping method used (fetch vs. Playwright).
5. Add HTML fixture(s) and a test in `packages/backend/tests/scrapers/`.
6. Register the adapter in `pipeline.ts`.
